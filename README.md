======================

My own personal tools for integrating RTM and Beeminder

You'll need a ~/.rtbmrc file that looks like this:

    [RTBM]
    api_key = YOUR API KEY
    api_secret = YOUR API SECRET

You'll also need to jump through an auth step with RTM.  This is
descriebd in the WebService::RTMAgent docs, and code is not included
(sorry!).
